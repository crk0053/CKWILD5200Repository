1.  The necessary sample size to detect a disease at 5% prevalence for a total population of 5000 deer at 95% confidence would be at least 59.

2.  a\. The necessary sample size to detect a disease at 1% prevalence for a large population at 95% confidence would approximately be at least 299.

    b\. The necessary sample size to detect a disease at 2% prevalence for a large population at 99% confidence would approximately be at least 229.

3.  We are 95% confident that EHD prevalence is \<1% in this facility.
