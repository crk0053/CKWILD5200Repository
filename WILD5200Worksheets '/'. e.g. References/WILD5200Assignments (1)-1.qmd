Jan's research focuses on an elk herd housed in an enclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

a\. Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25, and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

Incidence = The number of new cases/The number of the susceptible population.

The unit for incidence is the proportion of cases per susceptible population per unit of time.

The incidence for conjunctivitis on 06/12/25 is 0.098 cases per susceptible elk per day.

Since the cumulative cases prior to 06/12/25 amounts to 5, we subtract 5 from the susceptible population to achieve a denominator of 51. The number of new cases on 06/12/25 is 5. Therefore, we divide 5 by 51 to find the incidence of 0.098.

The incidence for conjunctivitis on 06/14/25 is 0.045 cases per susceptible elk per day.

Since the cumulative cases prior to 06/14/25 amounts to 12, we subtract 12 from the total susceptible population to achieve a denominator of 44. The number of new cases on 06/14/25 is 2. Therefore, we divide 2 by 44 to find the incidence of 0.045.

The incidence for conjunctivitis on 06/15/25 is 0.00 cases per susceptible elk per day.

Since the cumulative cases prior to 06/15/25 amounts to 14, we subtract 14 from the total susceptible population to achieve a denominator of 42. However, no new cases appeared on 06/15/25. Therefore, we divide 0 by 41 to find the incidence of 0.00.

b\. What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25?

Prevalence = \# of infected/total population

There is 21.4% prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25

We observe 12 infected elk on 06/13/25. Therefore, we divide 12 by 56 to calculate prevalence as a proportion of population to measure approximately 0.214. Then, we multiply this value by 100% to determine the units of prevalence.

There is 8.93% prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/16/25,

We observe 5 infected elk on 06/16/25. Therefore, we divide 5 by 56 to calculate prevalence as a proportion of population to measure approximately 0.0893. Then, we multiply this value by 100% to determine the units of prevalence.

c\. On which day is the prevalence the same as the incidence (except the units)?

The incidence and prevalence are the same on 06/10/25 with a value of 0.018.

Since prevalence = the number of infected/the total population, the prevalence is 1/56 on 06/10/25.

Since incidence = the number of new cases/the susceptible population per unit of time, the incidence is 1/56 on 06/10/25.

d\. On which day is incidence lowest?

The lowest incidence occurs on 06/15/25 and 06/16/25 as no new cases occur on each of those days. Therefore, the incidence is 0. Dividing 0 new cases by the susceptible population yields the lowest incidence for those two days.

7.  In 2015, Saiga antelope calving aggregations migrated to Central Kazakhstan and experienced a mass mortality event. The mass mortality is attributed to hemorrhagic septicemia caused by *Pasteurella multocida* type B. However, *Pasteurella* strains are typically found in both healthy and sick saigas. Characteristics of climate and livestock interactions were rather assessed to determine how the bacterial infection was exacerbated. Furthermore, modeling indicates that there were unusually high relative humidity levels and temperatures ahead of the mass mortality event, which demonstrates consistency with two previous outbreaks. Environmental triggers, such as aggregation stress, livestock transmission, and paramyxovirus infections, are further linked to the saiga antelopes' vulnerability to *Pasteurella multocida* outbreaks. To prevent future mass mortality events, livestock vaccination, anti-poaching actions, and disease modeling strategies can be implemented. Lastly, limiting human activities in the saiga antelopes' migration grounds is a broader conservation strategy to prevent extinction and ecological disruptions that act as stressors.

    9\. R~o~:the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population, where R~o~= 6 susceptible individuals/4 infected. R~o~= 1.5. Applying R~o~ indicates that one infectious individual on average causes 1.5 new infections within a fully susceptible population.

Basic tick identification includes four components, life stage, sex, genus, and species. Firstly, the presence of a genital pore and the number of legs are used to determine the life stage. A genital pore signifies that the tick is an adult. Additionally, leg number is used to confirm lifestage. If a tick has eight legs, then the tick is considered an adult or a nymph, which is further distinguished through a subjective size comparison. Otherwise, a tick is classified as larva if there are only six legs present. Next, the scutum is observed to identify a tick's sex. It is especially important to distinguish between conscutum and alloscutum features. Conscutum refers to a smooth body surface with ridges and punctuations, while alloscutum allows female ticks to engorge during blood meals. After sex identification, the genus can be distinguished. Anal groove position is observed to detect genus. The anal groove is either anterior or posterior (appears at the abdomen). Lastly, mouth parts and a dichotomous key are used to identify species, where mouth parts are differentiated by a protruding or a short head. The dichotomous key captures specific features of a tick to enhance identification. Integrating all of the necessary components is fundamental for basic tick identification.

Tick ecology is an increasingly relevant subject in discussions about public health implications. In the era of climate change and rising temperatures, ticks have undergone range expansion, alongside an increase in the frequency of tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme's disease, Powassan virus, and Alpha-gal. These disease produce various adverse health consequences, such as a suppressed immune system, meningitis, increased vulnerability to coinfection, and even death. Stakeholders have a responsibility to monitor land usage and the presence of ticks as vectors to mitigate the scope of tick-borne diseases.

**10/23/2025: Multihost Pathogens and Spillover**

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.

    False, MERS-CoV is not primarily maintained in humans. Although human-to-human transmission occurs in close contact, humans are not dead-end hosts and the virus does not sustain itself due to coinfection, public response, and cross immunity. Rather, MERS-CoV is maintained in bats as the resevoir hosts and underwent a host-shift event in camels as novel hosts.

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.

False, bats are the main animal resevoir for MERS-CoV. They maintain the virus without interactions from additional host species.

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.

False, humans are not dead-end hosts. They can transmit the infection with close, human-to-human contact. Transmission is especially associated with healthcare settings.

4.  The estimated case-fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%

False, the case-fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 35%, not 65%.

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source infection.

False, the epidemic curve presents a propogated outbreak. The peaks of the epidemic curve appear to be separated by each incubation period.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,\
    would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging\
    infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    Under Fenton and Pederson's community epidemiology framework, Marburg virus would be classified as a potential emerging infectious disease. Cross-species infection occurred between the resevoir hosts, Egyptian rousette bats, and humans. The Marburg virus is able to be maintained among human hosts through close human-to-human transmission, typically in healthcare settings, which extends beyond a single spillover event.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both\
    community and healthcare settings?

    Community prevention could be effective through preventative health education. Physicians and specialists could inform the public to be aware of bats as the reservoirs and ultimately reduce contact that could lead into transmission. Additionally, strict PPE adherence can be used for workers treating infected individuals and frequent cleaning can be employed to disinfect contaminated surface.

1.  Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission\
    in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ\
    between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive\
    measures recommended in each setting

Nipah virus transmission differs significantly between Malaysia and Bangladesh because of differences in ecology and human–animal interactions. In Malaysia, the primary transmission cycle involved fruit bats infecting pigs, which then served as bridge hosts and transmitted the virus to humans through close contact and respiratory exposure on pig farms. Most cases were linked directly to pig interactions. In Bangladesh, however, transmission is largely through the consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated with bat saliva or urine. Unlike Malaysia, Bangladesh has frequent human-to-human transmission, especially among household caregivers and in healthcare settings. These differences fundamentally influence prevention strategies. In Malaysia, preventive measures focus on improving farm biosecurity by reducing bat-to-pig contact, ensuring pigs do not eat contaminated fruits, and using protective equipment for workers. In Bangladesh, prevention centers on discouraging consumption of raw date palm sap, using protective coverings over sap collection pots, and strengthening infection control practices in healthcare settings to limit human-to-human spread.

2.  Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the\
    different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its\
    transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?\
    Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe\
    its impact on the affected population.

Avian reoviruses can spread through several routes, including horizontal transmission by the fecal-oral route, respiratory exposure, direct contact among birds, and indirect transmission through contaminated surfaces. They can also be transmitted vertically when infected hens pass the virus to their offspring through the egg. Environmental conditions such as high-density housing, poor ventilation, warm and humid climates, and heavily contaminated surfaces all influence transmission by allowing the virus to persist and spread easily. One pathogen characteristic that supports these routes is that ARV is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus. This structure allows it to persist in the environment. A wild bird disease caused by ARV is arthritis in species such as ducks and geese. In these populations, the virus causes joint swelling, reduced mobility, and decreased fitness, which can impair migration and increase vulnerability to predators.

3.  Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.\
    Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV\
    classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

Shrews are likely the resevoir of Langya henipavirus. Transmission often occurs through spillover from infected shrews to humans, likely through contact with contaminated materials. LayV is considered a spillover rather than a potential emerging infectious disease because cases have been infrequent, geographically limited, and associated with shrew exposure. Additionally, there is no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission or persistent infection. Without ongoing or expanding transmission in the human population, LayV does not indicate an emerging infectious disease and instead represents spillover.

1.  You have to analyze and summarize this data. Identify the patterns that emerge and\
    use the available data to explain the patterns. Analyze this dataset to determine\
    prevalence patterns and perform meaningful comparisons between different groups. For\
    example, you can compare prevalence of B. procyonis between the three regions,\
    between males and females in each region, between age classes in each region, etc.\
    Please show your work, use Quantitative Parasitology for your calculations and\
    comparisons. Provide confidence intervals for prevalence estimates. Finally, explain\
    your analysis of this real-world data.

Overall, 47% of the total raccoon population were infected, and the confidence interval for this estimate ranged from about 37% to about 57%.

When comparing regions, strong differences appeared. In the Central region, about 64% of raccoons were infected and the confidence interval ranged from about 35% to about 87%. In the South region, about 63% were infected with a confidence interval from about 47% to 77% percent. In contrast, the North region had a much lower prevalence of about 29% with a confidence interval from about 17% to 43% . This pattern suggests that raccoons in the Central and South regions encounter infective eggs much more often than those in the North.

Sex also showed clear differences. About 65% of females were infected, with a confidence interval from about 47% to 80%. Only about 38% of males were infected, with a confidence interval from about 26% to 50%. This indicates that female raccoons in this sample were more frequently exposed or more likely to maintain infection.

Age class showed less contrast. Adults had a prevalence of about 52%, with a confidence interval from about 40% to 64%. Young adults had a prevalence of about 38%, with a confidence interval from about 23% to 55%. Because their confidence intervals overlap so widely, age does not appear to strongly influence infection in this dataset. This suggests that raccoons are exposed relatively early in life and remain exposed as they mature.

Looking at worm burdens in infected animals also helps explain the ecological picture. Infected raccoons from the Central and South regions often carried heavier worm loads, while infected raccoons from the North generally had fewer worm loads. Females also tended to carry more worms on average than males. These heavier infections mean that Central and South raccoons, particularly females, may contribute more eggs to the environment, creating greater opportunities for transmission.

Overall, the data show that infection by B. procyonis is shaped most strongly by region and sex. The Central and South regions appear to be transmission hotspots, and females show both higher prevalence and higher worm intensities. Age does not show a strong effect. These patterns help clarify how the parasite circulates in raccoon populations and where environmental contamination may be greatest.

1.  In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in\
    the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic\
    spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard\
    poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain\
    why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

The zoonotic spread of Salmonella is especially driven by the ecological differences of backyard poultry. The extent of control exhibited in the bird-human interface substantially impacts transmission, especially regarding human behavior. Specifically, humans view of the backyard poultry as "pets" prompts increased risk of Salmonella infection, where humans will often cuddle with the birds and exhibit hand-to-mouth contact from contaminated surfaces. Children are most susceptible to these behaviors, but additional practices must be considered to holistically mitigate backyard poultry Salmonella transmission. These practices include inconsistent hygiene, non-standardized management, and allowing free roaming. The result of these practices enable Salmonella to persist in the external environment and, therefore, increased the risk of transmission in humans.

2.  Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë\
    coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in\
    grazing livestock.

    a\. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal\
    endophyte?

    Tall fescue gain a tolerance for droughts and overgrazing as a result of being infected with a fungal endophyte.

    b\. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of\
    fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?

    Fescue toxicosis is driven by various interactions in the external environment to determine the occurrence and severity in grazing systems. Namely, fescue toxicosis is a result of ergot alkaloid production from an infected endophyte. Four primary alkaloids are produced; however, the two most agronomically important are peramine and NFL, as they persist in the fescue, while ergovaline and lolitrem B are most toxic. These mechanisms significantly impact milk production, inhibiting economic growth; however, it is especially important to pinpoint the environmental interactions. The infection cycle underscores the importance of these interactions, indicating how the asexual cycle results in vertical transmission, while the sexual cycle leads to horizontal transmission. Furthermore, primary ecological and environmental drivers are temperature stress, drought stress, soil fertility, microbial communities, and grazing management strategies. The following factors require further consideration for their role in alkaloid production, endophyte expression, and toxin accumulation, and disease risk.

    c\. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

    Clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle include weight loss, rough, discolored hair coats, and poor performance.

**11/25/25**

1.  What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do\
    humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

African Swine fever can be transmitted through various routes. Namely, African Swine fever is developed through vector transmission, via tick bites. However, African Swine fever can also be transmitted through direct contact of bodily fluids and feces, indirect contact through contaminated surfaces, environmental persistence in carcasses, and through humans as mechanical vectors. African Swine fever is especially perpetuated through human activity. Humans have contributed to habitat overlap between conversation sites and pig farming operations, inconsistent biosecurity measures with the level of movement pigs exhibit and slaughtering pracitces, and overall landscape fragmentation.

2\. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity,\
progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

Co-infection with KoRV result in increased difficult for Koala populations to respond to Chlamydia. KoRV inhibits the function of the immune system, making Koalas more susceptible to infection, increasing prevalence among the population and severity of clinical symptoms. Overall, Koalas demonstrate higher mortality and infertility rates as a result of coinfection with KoRV.

3\. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of\
Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)?

There are various challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease. Diagnostic challenges undermine the integrity of surveillance systems by producing false negatives in PCR testing. Additionally, fungal spores persist in the external environment, namely in moist soil and decaying organic matter, making it inherently difficult to curtail direct and indirect horizontal transmission routes. Naturally, it is difficult to limit snake-to-snake interactions and human-to-snake interactions can result in transmission due to contact with contaminated surfaces. All of these considerations underscore the challenges to curb SFD in the external environment and among the snake-human interface.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**12/2/2025 WILD 5200 Final Exam**

1.  a\. False, spillover is not characterized by high between-species transmission and no within-target species transmission of a pathogen. Rather, spillover indicates cross-species infection with both low net between-species (H1 to H2) transmission and low net within-species (H2) transmission.

    b\. False, a disease caused by vectors is infectious as it resulted from pathogens that are transmissible. However, a disease only caused by vectors is not contagious because animal-to-animal transmission does not occur. Instead, transmission is dependent on the presence of vectors and infected hosts cannot transmit the disease to another individual.

    c\. False, *Baylisascaris procyonis* cannot be directly transmitted to humans through direct contact following excretion. Humans act as accidental hosts, where eggs hatch to larvae, result in nematode migration, and result in the onset of disease. Humans cannot be infected by the eggs immediately after excretion as the eggs are not yet infectious. The egg is embryonated with larva in the external environment for 2-4 weeks until they are hatched after ingestion in humans.

    d\. True

    e\. False, northern cardinals are not considered superspreaders for West Nile Virus. Rather, American robins are considered superspreaders due to cascading impacts of food scarcity that increase the prevalence of infected Culexes, resulting in infected Culex to infect more American robins.

2.  Community-based interventions for preventing dracunculiasis transmission includes protecting water sources with filters, preventing people and animals with emerging Guinea worms from entering water sources, and using larvicide in stagnant water reservoirs. Each intervention significantly impacts the life cycle of dracunculiasis. At the interventions, breaking the cycle of water fleas from entering into humans is paramount. Water fleas are unable to be ingested by humans and release larvae into the stomach, disrupting the mating process, preventing the migration to penetrate connective tissue, and limiting further exposure. This reality is especially true for filtering. Furthermore, preventing people and animals with emerging Guinea worms from entering water sources mitigates the release of first-stage larvae in the water. Therefore, water fleas cannot be infected by larvae and humans do not ingest infected waterfleas, thereby preventing the cycle from the start. Targeted use of larvicide acts in a similar manner by killing larvae before the infection of water fleas. Despite recent developments to eradicate Guinea worm, infections have reemerged as cases have soared in dogs. Efforts have been shifted to limit the mobility of dogs and modifying their behavior to prevent the consumption of contaminated fish entrails, proving to reduce Guinea worm infections in Chad and Ethiopia.

3.  There are various challenges that wildlife agencies face when managing the transmission of CWD. Prions that cause CWD do not easily degrade in the external environment and persist, increasing indirect transmission. Additionally, barriers to mitigate the transmission of CWD are at the forefront of these challenges. This includes a lack of available treatments and vaccinations, the difficulty to identify infected individuals, the disparities reflected in detection at early outbreak phases, the presence of asymptomatic carriers, and the inability to eliminate CWD once it is detected in a population.

4.  a\. **Incidence: a measure of risk that describes the new cases of a disease occurring within a susceptible population, where incidence = (Number of new cases in a time period)/(Total susceptible population)**

    **March 2025:**

    New Cases = 3, Susceptible Population = 60; Therefore, the incidence is 3/60 = 0.05 *M. leprae* cases per armadillo-month.

    **April 2025:**

    New Cases = 2, Susceptible Population = 57; Therefore, the incidence is 2/57 = 0.031 *M. leprae* cases per armadillo-month.

    **May 2025:**

    New Cases = 0, Susceptible Population = 55; Therefore, the incidence is 0/55 = 0 *M. leprae* cases per armadillo-month.

    **June 2025:**

    New Cases = 3, Susceptible Population = 55; Therefore, the incidence is 3/55 = 0.055 *M. leprae* cases per armadillo-month.

    **July 2025:**

    New Cases = 5, Susceptible Population = 52; Therefore, the incidence is 5/52 = 0.096 *M. leprae* cases per armadillo-month.

    b\. The highest prevalence occurred in July 2025 with 21.7% prevalence of *M. leprae*, while March 2025 exhibited the lowest of 5% prevalence *M. leprae.*

    **Calculations:**

    **Prevalence = (The number of infections)/(The total population)**

    **July 2025:**

    The number of infections = 13, The total population = 60; therefore, 13/60 = 0.217, 21.7% prevalence of *M. leprae.*

    **March 2025:**

    The number of infections = 3, The total population = 60; therefore, 3/60 = 0.05, 5% prevalence of *M. leprae.*

5.  a\. The etiological agent of Tularemia is *Francisella tularenesis.* The subspecies of this agent that causes Tularemia in aquatic animals is *F. tularenesis subspecies holartica* (Type B)*.*

    b\. Tularemia can be transmitted through vectors, such as Deer-flies, American Dog ticks, mosquitos, and Lonestar ticks. Additionally, transmission can occur upon direct contact with infected animals, ingestion of contaminated water or undercooked game meat, and inhalation through aerosols or dust, adding a layer of complexity to bioterrorism concerns.

    c\. In terms of Tularemia's significance in the human and public health sphere, the bacterium is considered a Category A bioterrorism agent as a result of its high infectivity and potential for aerosol spread, including the spread through vectors, such as mites, flies, and mosquitoes. The agent's role as a bioterrorism strategy requires significant consideration in its ability to infect humans. Although humans are considered dead-end hosts of Tularemia, the route of transmission is particularly significant to assess how clinical symptoms develop in humans. Namely, common signs and symptoms include fever, fatigue, anorexia, myalgia, and sore throat; however, different forms of Tularemia, such as ulceroglandular, glandular, and pneumonic, are indicative of how different transmission routes lead to symptoms and varying levels of severity. This results in Tularemia having a 24% death rate if treatment stalls. Otherwise, the death rate is 2% with timely intervention. Although Tularemia exhibits a relatively small death rate with treatment, its high infectivity, its associated risk as a bioterrorism agent, its various transmission routes, and its spread as a result of migration patterns pose serious public health implications.

6.  a\. *Pseudogymnoascus destructans*

    b\. Aetokthonotoxin

    c\. Powassan encephalitis

    d\. African Swine Fever

    e\. *Borrelia burgdorferi*

7.  a\. Nymphs, adults

    b\. Small mammals, birds

    c\. May-July, October-December

    d\. White-footed mice, reproductive host.

8.  The Georgia DNR's CWD surveillance system employs a hypergeometric distribution to estimate that CWD prevalence does not exceed 0.02%. Hypergeometric distribution estimates are employed to apply sample prevalence to a broader population, requiring a sufficient and representative sample. However, a representative sample requires random sampling and a normally distributed condition among the population, which are not entirely feasible in wildlife populations. This can result in infected white-tailed deer to be undetected in this hypergeometric distribution's sampling regime, indicating that disease is unlikely or low enough to be considered negligible. When, in reality, disease distribution in the white-tailed deer population can be uneven or clustered. Overall, the hypergeometric distribution can result in biased sampling and undermine the real presence of CWD in the white-tailed deer population.

9.  a\. SARS-CoV-2 is categorized in the upper left quadrant, an emerging infectious disease. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates cross-species infection; however, low between-species transmission occurs, while high within-H2 transmission rate is exhibited.

    b\. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in the Americas demonstrates low-between species transmission as humans are typically infected through aerosolized feces. However, there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, making Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome a result of spillover and belonging in the lower left quadrant.

    c\. Langya Henipavirus is categorized in the lower left quadrant, being a spillover. Langya Henipavirus reports no confirmed human-to-human transmission and exhibits very low prevalence among humans.

    d\. Brucellosis is categorized in the upper right quadrant, being a true multihost pathogen. Brucellosis exhibits both high within-species and between-species transmission rates.

    e\. West Nile Virus is categorized in the lower left quadrant, being a spillover. West Nile Virus exhibits both low within-species and between-species transmission rates.

10. **Definitive Host:** marine mammals as *Anisakis simplex* can reach sexual maturity and reproduce.

    **Dead-End Host:** humans as they are susceptible to the infection, but cannot effectively transmit Anisakiasis.

    **Paratenic Host:** seafish and cephalopods as no further development of the parasite occurs. Rather, they serve to transport the pathogen to humans.

    **Intermediate Hosts:** crustaceans as they are necessary for larva to continue developing inside them, making them required for transmission to the next host.

11. Not all infected hosts are diseases as they do not always exhibit clinical symptoms to categorize disease. For example, white-tailed deer infected with meningeal worm rarely exhibit any symptoms or clinical disease. Therefore, white-tailed deer are only considered infected, not diseased. The white-tailed deer can still pass infectious larvae through their feces. And, after undergoing the appropriate meningeal disease cycle, can infect elk, which often exhibit clinical signs and are categorized as diseased. Pathogen dynamics further reveal that not all infected hosts develop disease. Moreover, in humans, Covid-19 infection can occur, but does not always result in the development of clinical symptoms or disease.

12. **Vaccination Threshold = (1-1/Basic Reproduction Number)**

    1-(1/2.5) = 0.6. 60% of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV.

13. There are various factors that pose difficulties in managing wildlife diseases. These include habitat overlap, lack of proper biosecurity measures, the unavailability of treatment and vaccines, seasonal changes, and an inability to monitor free-ranging hosts. In terms of habitat overlap, this is demonstrated with increased cases of African Swine Fever. As a result of agricultural expansion, habitat fragmentation has resulted in an increased stressor, resulting in an increase in African Swine Fever. Additionally, this pattern is observed with various other disease systems and is not exclusive to African Swine Fever. This is evident in increased *Salmonella enterica* cases, where limited education of backyard poultry farmers has resulted in inconsistent and often lackluster biosecurity measures. With humans and backyard poultry living within close proximity of each other, the human-poultry interface reflects increased exposure to *S. enterica* among humans. Although *S. enterica* transmission is highly preventable among backyard poultry farmers, antimicrobial resistance of strains poses an additional barrier to mitigate the spread of disease, allowing the bacterium to persist in the environment. Furthermore, the unavailability of treatment and vaccines poses another complex threat to the management of wildlife diseases. As demonstrated with CWD in cervids, no vaccinations or treatments has disproportionately burdened wildlife agencies as increasing questions arise about CWD's potential for spillover. Seasonal and climactic phenomenon is another significant barrier in managing wildlife diseases. For example, with Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, El Nino results in an increase in the rodent population, translating into an increase in disease incidence. Seasonal and climactic changes place wildlife agencies in a precarious position when assessing wildlife behavior and range expansion, even modifying approaches to tick-borne diseases as a result. Lastly, an inability to manage free-ranging hosts represents a significant barrier to mitigating wildlife disease. This is further demonstrated in CWD surveillance, where free-ranging hosts contribute to underrepresented samples in CWD prevalence estimates. Overall, there are various factors that contribute to the difficulty of managing wildlife diseases. Further exploration of how each mechanism must be targeted is needed.
