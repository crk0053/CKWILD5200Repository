Jan's research focuses on an elk herd housed in an enclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

a\. Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25, and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

Incidence = The number of new cases/The number of the susceptible population.

The unit for incidence is the proportion of cases per susceptible population per unit of time.

The incidence for conjunctivitis on 06/12/25 is 0.098 cases per susceptible elk per day.

Since the cumulative cases prior to 06/12/25 amounts to 5, we subtract 5 from the susceptible population to achieve a denominator of 51. The number of new cases on 06/12/25 is 5. Therefore, we divide 5 by 51 to find the incidence of 0.098.

The incidence for conjunctivitis on 06/14/25 is 0.045 cases per susceptible elk per day.

Since the cumulative cases prior to 06/14/25 amounts to 12, we subtract 12 from the total susceptible population to achieve a denominator of 44. The number of new cases on 06/14/25 is 2. Therefore, we divide 2 by 44 to find the incidence of 0.045.

The incidence for conjunctivitis on 06/15/25 is 0.00 cases per susceptible elk per day.

Since the cumulative cases prior to 06/15/25 amounts to 14, we subtract 14 from the total susceptible population to achieve a denominator of 42. However, no new cases appeared on 06/15/25. Therefore, we divide 0 by 41 to find the incidence of 0.00.

b\. What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25?

Prevalence = \# of infected/total population

There is 21.4% prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25

We observe 12 infected elk on 06/13/25. Therefore, we divide 12 by 56 to calculate prevalence as a proportion of population to measure approximately 0.214. Then, we multiply this value by 100% to determine the units of prevalence.

There is 8.93% prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/16/25,

We observe 5 infected elk on 06/16/25. Therefore, we divide 5 by 56 to calculate prevalence as a proportion of population to measure approximately 0.0893. Then, we multiply this value by 100% to determine the units of prevalence.

c\. On which day is the prevalence the same as the incidence (except the units)?

The incidence and prevalence are the same on 06/10/25 with a value of 0.018.

Since prevalence = the number of infected/the total population, the prevalence is 1/56 on 06/10/25.

Since incidence = the number of new cases/the susceptible population per unit of time, the incidence is 1/56 on 06/10/25.

d\. On which day is incidence lowest?

The lowest incidence occurs on 06/15/25 and 06/16/25 as no new cases occur on each of those days. Therefore, the incidence is 0. Dividing 0 new cases by the susceptible population yields the lowest incidence for those two days.

7.  In 2015, Saiga antelope calving aggregations migrated to Central Kazakhstan and experienced a mass mortality event. The mass mortality is attributed to hemorrhagic septicemia caused by *Pasteurella multocida* type B. However, *Pasteurella* strains are typically found in both healthy and sick saigas. Characteristics of climate and livestock interactions were rather assessed to determine how the bacterial infection was exacerbated. Furthermore, modeling indicates that there were unusually high relative humidity levels and temperatures ahead of the mass mortality event, which demonstrates consistency with two previous outbreaks. Environmental triggers, such as aggregation stress, livestock transmission, and paramyxovirus infections, are further linked to the saiga antelopes' vulnerability to *Pasteurella multocida* outbreaks. To prevent future mass mortality events, livestock vaccination, anti-poaching actions, and disease modeling strategies can be implemented. Lastly, limiting human activities in the saiga antelopes' migration grounds is a broader conservation strategy to prevent extinction and ecological disruptions that act as stressors.

    9\. R~o~:the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population, where R~o~= 6 susceptible individuals/4 infected. R~o~= 1.5. Applying R~o~ indicates that one infectious individual on average causes 1.5 new infections within a fully susceptible population.

Basic tick identification includes four components, life stage, sex, genus, and species. Firstly, the presence of a genital pore and the number of legs are used to determine the life stage. A genital pore signifies that the tick is an adult. Additionally, leg number is used to confirm lifestage. If a tick has eight legs, then the tick is considered an adult or a nymph, which is further distinguished through a subjective size comparison. Otherwise, a tick is classified as larva if there are only six legs present. Next, the scutum is observed to identify a tick's sex. It is especially important to distinguish between conscutum and alloscutum features. Conscutum refers to a smooth body surface with ridges and punctuations, while alloscutum allows female ticks to engorge during blood meals. After sex identification, the genus can be distinguished. Anal groove position is observed to detect genus. The anal groove is either anterior or posterior (appears at the abdomen). Lastly, mouth parts and a dichotomous key are used to identify species, where mouth parts are differentiated by a protruding or a short head. The dichotomous key captures specific features of a tick to enhance identification. Integrating all of the necessary components is fundamental for basic tick identification.

Tick ecology is an increasingly relevant subject in discussions about public health implications. In the era of climate change and rising temperatures, ticks have undergone range expansion, alongside an increase in the frequency of tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme's disease, Powassan virus, and Alpha-gal. These disease produce various adverse health consequences, such as a suppressed immune system, meningitis, increased vulnerability to coinfection, and even death. Stakeholders have a responsibility to monitor land usage and the presence of ticks as vectors to mitigate the scope of tick-borne diseases.

**10/23/2025: Multihost Pathogens and Spillover**

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.

    False, MERS-CoV is not primarily maintained in humans. Although human-to-human transmission occurs in close contact, humans are not dead-end hosts and the virus does not sustain itself due to coinfection, public response, and cross immunity. Rather, MERS-CoV is maintained in bats as the resevoir hosts and underwent a host-shift event in camels as novel hosts.

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.

False, bats are the main animal resevoir for MERS-CoV. They maintain the virus without interactions from additional host species.

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.

False, humans are not dead-end hosts. They can transmit the infection with close, human-to-human contact. Transmission is especially associated with healthcare settings.

4.  The estimated case-fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%

False, the case-fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 35%, not 65%.

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source infection.

False, the epidemic curve presents a propogated outbreak. The peaks of the epidemic curve appear to be separated by each incubation period.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,\
    would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging\
    infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    Under Fenton and Pederson's community epidemiology framework, Marburg virus would be classified as a potential emerging infectious disease. Cross-species infection occurred between the resevoir hosts, Egyptian rousette bats, and humans. The Marburg virus is able to be maintained among human hosts through close human-to-human transmission, typically in healthcare settings, which extends beyond a single spillover event.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both\
    community and healthcare settings?

    Community prevention could be effective through preventative health education. Physicians and specialists could inform the public to be aware of bats as the reservoirs and ultimately reduce contact that could lead into transmission. Additionally, strict PPE adherence can be used for workers treating infected individuals and frequent cleaning can be employed to disinfect contaminated surface.

1.  Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission\
    in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ\
    between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive\
    measures recommended in each setting

Nipah virus transmission differs significantly between Malaysia and Bangladesh because of differences in ecology and human–animal interactions. In Malaysia, the primary transmission cycle involved fruit bats infecting pigs, which then served as bridge hosts and transmitted the virus to humans through close contact and respiratory exposure on pig farms. Most cases were linked directly to pig interactions. In Bangladesh, however, transmission is largely through the consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated with bat saliva or urine. Unlike Malaysia, Bangladesh has frequent human-to-human transmission, especially among household caregivers and in healthcare settings. These differences fundamentally influence prevention strategies. In Malaysia, preventive measures focus on improving farm biosecurity by reducing bat-to-pig contact, ensuring pigs do not eat contaminated fruits, and using protective equipment for workers. In Bangladesh, prevention centers on discouraging consumption of raw date palm sap, using protective coverings over sap collection pots, and strengthening infection control practices in healthcare settings to limit human-to-human spread.

2.  Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the\
    different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its\
    transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?\
    Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe\
    its impact on the affected population.

Avian reoviruses can spread through several routes, including horizontal transmission by the fecal-oral route, respiratory exposure, direct contact among birds, and indirect transmission through contaminated surfaces. They can also be transmitted vertically when infected hens pass the virus to their offspring through the egg. Environmental conditions such as high-density housing, poor ventilation, warm and humid climates, and heavily contaminated surfaces all influence transmission by allowing the virus to persist and spread easily. One pathogen characteristic that supports these routes is that ARV is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus. This structure allows it to persist in the environment. A wild bird disease caused by ARV is arthritis in species such as ducks and geese. In these populations, the virus causes joint swelling, reduced mobility, and decreased fitness, which can impair migration and increase vulnerability to predators.

3.  Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.\
    Describe the likely reservoir and transmission

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    route of Langya virus. Why is LayV\
    classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

Shrews are likely the resevoir of Langya henipavirus. Transmission often occurs through spillover from infected shrews to humans, likely through contact with contaminated materials. LayV is considered a spillover rather than a potential emerging infectious disease because cases have been infrequent, geographically limited, and associated with shrew exposure. Additionally, there is no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission or persistent infection. Without ongoing or expanding transmission in the human population, LayV does not indicate an emerging infectious disease and instead represents spillover.

1.  In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in\
    the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic\
    spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard\
    poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain\
    why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

The zoonotic spread of Salmonella is especially driven by the ecological differences of backyard poultry. The extent of control exhibited in the bird-human interface substantially impacts transmission, especially regarding human behavior. Specifically, humans view of the backyard poultry as "pets" prompts increased risk of Salmonella infection, where humans will often cuddle with the birds and exhibit hand-to-mouth contact from contaminated surfaces. Children are most susceptible to these behaviors, but additional practices must be considered to holistically mitigate backyard poultry Salmonella transmission. These practices include inconsistent hygiene, non-standardized management, and allowing free roaming. The result of these practices enable Salmonella to persist in the external environment and, therefore, increased the risk of transmission in humans.

2.  Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë\
    coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in\
    grazing livestock.

    a\. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal\
    endophyte?

    Tall fescue gain a tolerance for droughts and overgrazing as a result of being infected with a fungal endophyte.

    b\. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of\
    fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?

    Fescue toxicosis is driven by various interactions in the external environment to determine the occurrence and severity in grazing systems. Namely, fescue toxicosis is a result of ergot alkaloid production from an infected endophyte. Four primary alkaloids are produced; however, the two most agronomically important are peramine and NFL, as they persist in the fescue, while ergovaline and lolitrem B are most toxic. These mechanisms significantly impact milk production, inhibiting economic growth; however, it is especially important to pinpoint the environmental interactions. The infection cycle underscores the importance of these interactions, indicating how the asexual cycle results in vertical transmission, while the sexual cycle leads to horizontal transmission. Furthermore, primary ecological and environmental drivers are temperature stress, drought stress, soil fertility, microbial communities, and grazing management strategies. The following factors require further consideration for their role in alkaloid production, endophyte expression, and toxin accumulation, and disease risk.

    c\. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

    Clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle include weight loss, rough, discolored hair coats, and poor performance.

1.  What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do\
    humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

African Swine fever can be transmitted through various routes. Namely, African Swine fever is developed through vector transmission, via tick bites. However, African Swine fever can also be transmitted through direct contact of bodily fluids and feces, indirect contact through contaminated surfaces, environmental persistence in carcasses, and through humans as mechanical vectors. African Swine fever is especially perpetuated through human activity. Humans have contributed to habitat overlap between conversation sites and pig farming operations, inconsistent biosecurity measures with the level of movement pigs exhibit and slaughtering pracitces, and overall landscape fragmentation.

2\. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity,\
progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

Co-infection with KoRV result in increased difficult for Koala populations to respond to Chlamydia. KoRV inhibits the function of the immune system, making Koalas more susceptible to infection, increasing prevalence among the population and severity of clinical symptoms. Overall, Koalas demonstrate higher mortality and infertility rates as a result of coinfection with KoRV.

3\. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of\
Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)?

There are various challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease. Diagnostic challenges undermine the integrity of surveillance systems by producing false negatives in PCR testing. Additionally, fungal spores persist in the external environment, namely in moist soil and decaying organic matter, making it inherently difficult to curtail direct and indirect horizontal transmission routes. Naturally, it is difficult to limit snake-to-snake interactions and human-to-snake interactions can result in transmission due to contact with contaminated surfaces. All of these considerations underscore the challenges to curb SFD in the external environment and among the snake-human interface.
